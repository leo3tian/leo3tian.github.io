                American Universities and Unethical Meal Plans

                    As the price of American universities skyrocket, students and families look to meal plans to save more money. 
                    Yet, though meal plans may seem like convenient ways to save on food, the reality is that meal plans lock students 
                    into an agreement with colleges to pay for overpriced and low-quality food. Using mandatory meal plans, American 
                    universities in the 21st century have forced students to purchase overpriced and often low-quality food.

            <p>
                    Let’s just get it out of the way. If you’re a college student, you’re most likely severely overpaying for food. 
                    Though the average American spends as low as $4 per meal, college students with meal plans are spending on average 
                    $12 per meal – three times more than the national average (Source). This overspending happens even as most colleges 
                    claim to help students save money through meal plans. For instance, Seattle University’s website on meal plans 
                    claims that their meal plan provides superior “value” compared to cooking for yourself, yet one look at their 
                    meal prices showed that they far exceeded the national average of $4.

                So, the quality and price of dining hall meals isn’t the best. Why are students unable to opt out? In order to live on-campus, students around the nation are required by universities to purchase a minimum meal plan. Even if a student plans to cook their own food or eat off-campus, schools enforce a minimum meal plan as a way of forcing students to spend money at campus-run dining halls. Enforcing a mandatory minimum meal plan has a disadvantage for students, which is that students unable to use the entirety of their dining plan waste money. In a study done at the Arizona State University, researchers found that students rarely ever used their entire meal plan (van Woerden). For many university students, unused meal plan funds are dropped at the end of the quarter or year – meaning plenty of money is being taken out of the pockets of students and their families. For some students, universities offer an option to spend their dining hall credits at campus grocery stores, yet these
