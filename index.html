                American Universities and Unethical Meal Plans

            </h2>
            <p>
                As the price of American universities skyrocket, students and families look to meal plans to save more money. Yet, though meal plans may seem like convenient ways to save on food, the reality is that meal plans lock students into an agreement with colleges to pay for overpriced and low-quality food. Using mandatory meal plans, American universities in the 21st century have forced students to purchase overpriced and often low-quality food.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s just get it out of the way. If you’re a college student, you’re most likely severely overpaying for food. Though the average American spends as low as $4 per meal, college students with meal plans are spending on average $12 per meal – three times more than the national average (Source). This overspending happens even as most colleges claim to help students save money through meal plans. For instance, the Arizona State University website on meal plans boasts “Great value” and vows to “Only save you money” that their meal plan provides superior “value” compared to cooking for yourself, yet one look at their meal prices showed that they far exceed the national average of $4, with their cheapest plan at $17 per meal.

                So, the quality and price of dining hall meals isn’t the best. So, us students should just opt out, right? Sadly, no – in order to live on-campus, students around the nation are required by universities to purchase a minimum meal plan. Even if a student plans to cook their own food or eat off-campus, schools enforce a minimum meal plan that forces students to spend money at campus-run dining halls. Enforcing a mandatory minimum meal plan has a disadvantage for students, which is that students who are unable to use the entirety of their dining plan end up wasting money. In a study conducted at Arizona State University, researchers found that students rarely ever used their entire meal plan (van Woerden). For many university students, unused meal plan funds are dropped at the end of the quarter or year – meaning plenty of money is being taken out of the pockets of students and their families. However, some universities offer ways to spend their dining hall credits at the end of the schoolyear, such as at campus grocery stores – yet these options suffer from the same high prices that plague dining hall meals.

                Many claim that the high costs for dining hall meals are justified, and that is true to some extent. Dining facilities, such as Tulane’s $55 million dining hall dubbed “The Commons,” can cost a fortune to construct and universities pay the price with profits from their meal plans. Dining facilities also have high operating costs, employing large amounts of full-time staff and buying up ingredients for cooking. Yet, it’s unfair to put the burden of paying these costs on students. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The main reason dining halls are so expensive is that most universities run their dining halls as businesses – meaning they expect some sort of profit in return. This means the extra money that students are paying for meal plans 
Furthermore, many universities have a monopoly on their food. They build convenient locations for students, then charge lots to force students to buy. 
Solutions:
1.	Run dining halls as a service and not a business
2.	Make meal plans optional for students living on campus.
