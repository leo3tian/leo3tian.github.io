                American Universities and Unethical Meal Plans

                    As the price of American universities skyrocket, students and families may look to meal plans to save more money. 
                    Plenty of these meal plans look great on paper – they’re marketed as convenient and healthy food plans with 
                    promises to deliver value to students and families. Yet, under this façade that many universities tout, the 
                    reality is that meal plans serve only to benefit the university while forcing students to pay for overpriced 
                    and low-quality food. Meal plan policies enforced by American universities are harmful to students and their 
                    wallets. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let’s just get it out of the way – If you have a university meal plan, you’re most likely severely overpaying 
                    for food. Though the average American spends as low as $4 per meal, college students with meal plans are spending 
                    on average $12 per meal – three times more than the national average (money.com source). This overspending happens 
                    even as most colleges claim to help students save money through meal plans. For instance, the Arizona State 
                    University website on meal plans boasts “Great value” and vows to “Only save you money” (link to ASU), yet 
                    one look at their meal prices showed that they far exceed the national average of $4, with their cheapest plan 
                    at $17 per meal. Though some universities offer alternatives to dining halls like student grocery stores, prices 
                    for food are still higher than traditional grocery stores. For example, while trying to find ways to use the 
                    money in my University of Washington Seattle dining card, I’ve seen granola bars go for up to $4 each 
                    (A 10-pack of them at Safeway is $5). At Chartwells University, students have reported $19 for just a case of 
                    water, which can be purchased elsewhere for just $5.47. It’s confusing that the university food options, which 
                    should cheap and convenient for students, actually have pricing that’s worse than grocery stores not even meant 
                    for students. Unreasonably high meal and food prices such as these affects everyone on campus, but can be 
                    especially harmful to students from low-income backgrounds and their families, who are especially likely to buy 
                    into the marketing around university meal plans. In a study conducted by the HOPE Lab at UW Madison, researchers 
                    discovered that as much as 78% of students across the nation have difficulty paying their bills, resorting to 
                    cutting back on food (Source 3). Students already juggling the high price of tuition, books, school materials, 
                    and housing can be brought under by high meal prices, all while thinking they are saving on food.

                    Even when students pay such a high premium for dining hall food, dining halls around the country fail to provide 
                    quality food. Many colleges serve food lacking in nutrients (Source). ASU food insecurity statistics. Dining halls 
                    around the nation are notorious for providing poor meal options full of processed foods 
                    (https://diatribe.org/foundation/about-us/dialogue/college-students-want-eat-healthy-so-why-do-dining-
                    halls-have-processed-foods), and in extreme cases, food may even be rotten (incident source). 
                    Students with mandatory meal plans, and thus must eat at dining halls, may end up malnourished and 
                    spending even more on food from other sources. (Malnourished data)

                <p>
                    Here’s the worst part of it all – the majority of students are required by universities to purchase a minimum meal plan if they hope to live on campus. Here at UW, the minimum meal plan is $1200 per quarter – meaning even if you never want to eat food, you still have to spend $1200. Even if a student plans to cook their own food or eat off-campus, schools enforce a minimum meal plan that forces students to spend money at campus-run dining halls. Enforcing a mandatory minimum meal plan has a disadvantage for students, which is that students who are unable to use the entirety of their dining plan end up wasting money. In a study conducted at Arizona State University, researchers found that students rarely ever used their entire meal plan (van Woerden). For many university students, unused meal plan funds are dropped at the end of the quarter or year – meaning plenty of money is being taken out of the pockets of students and their families. However, some universities offer ways to spend their dining hall credits at the end of the schoolyear, such as at campus grocery stores – yet these options suffer from the same high prices that plague dining hall meals.

                    Many claim that the high costs for dining hall meals are justified, and that is true to some extent. Dining facilities, such as Tulane’s $55 million dining hall dubbed “The Commons,” can cost a fortune to construct and universities pay the price with profits from their meal plans. Dining facilities also have high operating costs, employing large amounts of full-time staff and buying up ingredients for cooking. 
Yet, it’s unfair to put the burden of paying these costs on students. These claims however fail to address the underlying problem with college dining halls, and that is the way universities treat it like a business. Most universities run their dining halls as businesses – meaning they expect some sort of profit in return. As universities attempt to lower tuition costs, they have been looking for other ways to earn money through “auxillary services” and dining halls happen to be one of them. In 20xx, public universities brought in over 4 billion in profits from dining halls alone. This means that the extra money students are spending for $19 cases of water and $4 granola bars are going straight into the pockets of universities.
