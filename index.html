                A web article by Leo Tian
            </h2>
            <div class="article">
                <p>
                    As the price of attending university <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/college-tuition-inflation">skyrockets</a> across the nation, students and their families, scrambling for ways to save money, may look towards university meal plans to relieve financial stress. Plenty of university meal plans look great on paper – us students are promised convenience, health, and value, but the reality is far from that. College meal plans are a multi-billion-dollar profit machine that fails to address student needs. In this article, I will be discussing how meal plans force students to pay for overpriced and low-quality food, costing students their well-being and their wallets. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let’s just get it out of the way – If you have a university meal plan, you’re most likely severely overpaying for food. Though the average American spends as low as $4 per meal, college students with meal plans are spending on <a href="https://money.com/why-food-college-expensive/">average $12 per meal</a>. That’s three times more than the national average, meaning universities are charging extremely high prices and failing to provide economical options. 
                </p>

                        A screenshot of ASU’s 2023-2024 cheapest meal plan, offering 7 meals a week for $1740 a semester – that’s roughly $16.5 per meal. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    These high prices exist even as most colleges claim to help students save money through meal plans. For instance, the Arizona State University website on meal plans <a href="https://sundevilhospitality.asu.edu/meal-plans/traditional-meal-plans">boasts “Great value” and vows to “Only save you money”</a>, yet one look at their meal prices shows that they far exceed the national average of $4 with their cheapest plan at $17 per meal. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though some universities offer alternatives to dining halls such as university-run grocery stores, prices for food there still far exceed what average Americans are paying for food. At Chartwells University, students have reported <a href="https://www.proquest.com/wire-feeds/expensive-meal-plans-fail-suit-student-lifestyle/docview/2343257304/se-2">$19 for a case of bottled water</a>, which elsewhere would cost only $5.47. A month ago I walked into the University of Washington District Market (our university-run grocery store) for a quick snack, only to find granola bars going for up to $4 each. Meanwhile, a pack of ten at the local Safeway is $5. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Food prices at university-run grocery stores are several times higher than retail prices at regular grocery stores, which once again shows the lack of low-cost and high-value options for students that hope to spend their meal plan. If universities really hope to provide students value, they must offer cheaper options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unreasonably high meal and food prices such as these affect everyone on campus, but they’re especially harmful to students from low-income backgrounds and their families. In a study conducted by the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00091383.2016.1121081">HOPE Lab at UW Madison</a>, researchers discovered that as much as 78% of students across the nation have difficulty paying their bills, resorting to cutting back on food. Students already juggling the high price of tuition, books, school materials, and housing will be brought under by high meal prices, all while thinking they are saving on food. In addition, low-income students and families are especially likely to buy into the marketing around university meal plans that emphasizes the supposed value provided by meal plans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given that students pay such a high premium for meal plan food, it’s expected that we should receive at least decent quality food. For most, even this isn’t the case. An assessment by Krista Leischner, a researcher at the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6023427/">South Dakota State University Health & Nutritional Sciences Department</a>, categorizes an overwhelming majority of dining hall food as low-health and lacking in nutrients. Dining halls around the nation are notorious for providing poor meal options <a href="https://diatribe.org/foundation/about-us/dialogue/college-students-want-eat-healthy-so-why-do-dining-halls-have-processed-foods">full of processed foods</a>, and in extreme cases, food may even be rotten. Students this year at the University of Minnesota have launched a <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/u-of-m-students-taking-issue-with-subpar-food-service-on-campus">series of complaints</a> towards their dining hall regarding undercooked and spoiled food. Poor food quality, even when students are paying such a high amount for meal plans, is unacceptable as some students have no choice but to spend their meal plans on dining hall food. Students like these may end up malnourished or even sick, making everyday life miserable and adding stress onto an already stressful life. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here’s the worst part of it all – most students are required by universities to purchase a minimum meal plan if they hope to live on campus. For reference, each of the top five public schools (Texas A&M, University of Central Florida, Ohio State, NYU, and ASU) enforce mandatory meal plans for first and second-year students living on campus. Here at UW, the minimum meal plan is $1200 per quarter – meaning even if you plan on never eating dining hall food, you still have to shell out $1200 every academic quarter. Mandatory meal plans such as these leave students and families no choice but to accept greater costs of living, even if students can cook their own food or eat off-campus. For many university students, unused meal plan funds are dropped at the end of the quarter or year – meaning students who are unable to use the entirety of their dining plan end up wasting money. Every year, policies like these take huge amounts of money out of the pockets of students and their families. In a <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu11040904">study conducted at Arizona State University</a>, researchers found that students rarely ever used their entire meal plan. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many claim that the high costs for dining hall meals are justified, and this argument is understandable. Colleges are demanded to provide food that is both healthy and accessible for a large population of students, including many with allergies, intolerances, and vegetarian preferences. Thus, many claim that the high cost of meal plan food is a must, as it goes into producing quality food. These claims however fail to address the severe lack of quality food discussed before – if colleges were truly spending their meal plan revenue on higher quality food, standards would be far higher than the unhealthy and low-quality food discussed earlier.

                    Dining facilities, such as Tulane’s $55 million dining hall dubbed “The Commons,” can cost a fortune to construct and universities pay the price with profits from their meal plans. Dining facilities also have high operating costs, employing large amounts of full-time staff and buying up ingredients for cooking. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, we must consider the underlying problem with college dining halls, and that is the way universities treat it like a business. Most universities run their dining halls as businesses – meaning they expect some sort of profit in return. As universities attempt to lower tuition costs, they have been looking for other ways to earn money through “auxillary services” and dining halls happen to be one of them. In the 2013-2014 academic year, public universities brought in over $2.3 billion in profits from auxiliary services alone. Essentially, the extra money students are spending for $19 cases of water and $4 granola bars are going straight into the pockets of universities. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what can we as students do to fix this? Arguably the easiest and most immediately effective change that universities can make is to make meal plans optional for students living on campus. This gives students the freedom to choose based on their budget and preferences. For example, if a student wanted to save money by cooking their own food, they could simply opt out of meal plans and spend their money at local grocery stores where food is far cheaper. Another solution is for universities to run dining halls as a service, rather than a business. This change, though quite large, would ensure that all revenue from dining halls go back into dining halls, meaning students’ food quality would reflect the prices they are paying and vice versa.
